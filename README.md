# Hello-World
Hello there!!
I am Rashmi R, I belong to Bangalore.
I am getting started with github platform and learning it afresh.
I hope this would help me to manage and access my codes way better than any other platform.
I'm very passionate python programming intermediate.

This is a line which I am adding to check whether git push and pull works and have to commit the changes too.

This is one more line to try git pull . This line will go from remote repository to my computer.
